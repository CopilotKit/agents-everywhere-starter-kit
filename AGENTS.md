# Notes for coding agents

Read [hackathon-overview.md](hackathon-overview.md), [hackathon-rules.md](hackathon-rules.md), and [using-sponsor-tools.md](using-sponsor-tools.md), then the chosen app README in `apps/channel`, `apps/web`, or `apps/mobile`. Build the team's own workflow; the incident app is infrastructure reference code.

CopilotKit powers the Slack and web templates. The mobile starting point in `apps/mobile` has its own install and environment; follow its README for setup and checks.

For setup, follow [CopilotKit onboarding](README.md#copilotkit-onboarding) after choosing an app. For Slack, run `npm run channel:setup -- --no-clipboard` and continue with the emitted prompt and installed `channels-setup` skill. For web, explain the model-only and Intelligence options before starting the official `onboard start` workflow. For mobile, follow the Expo setup instructions in `apps/mobile/README.md`, including its runtime in `apps/web`. Preserve the chosen app and its working behavior; do not scaffold over this checkout or provision every template. Use current CLI instructions instead of copying authentication and provisioning steps from memory.

Read `.agents/skills/build-channels-agent/SKILL.md` before touching anything in
`apps/channel/`. It carries the verified API surface; the most common
failure mode in this codebase is inventing a plausible-looking Channels API.

Hard-won rules that are easy to get wrong here:

- **`@ag-ui/client` must stay deduped.** The root `package.json` pins it via
  `overrides` to the exact version `@copilotkit/runtime` declares. Two copies
  produce two `AbstractAgent` types and every `createChannel({ agent })` fails
  on a private `_debug` property. If you bump `@copilotkit/runtime`, re-check
  `npm ls @ag-ui/client` and update the override.
- **`@copilotkit/channels` and `@copilotkit/runtime` are a tested pair.** Bump
  together, keep them exact.
- **Files containing JSX must be `.tsx`**, and the tsconfig must set
  `jsxImportSource: "@copilotkit/channels"`. This is not React.
- **`maxSteps` defaults to 1** on `BuiltInAgent`. Any agent with tools needs more,
  or it calls one tool and stops before seeing the result.
- **Do not add `identifyUser` to `CopilotRuntime`.** It belongs on
  `createChannel`, and must be absent on a Channels-only runtime.
- **Handlers return `void`.** `thread.post()` returns a `MessageRef`, so a
  concise arrow body fails under `strict`. Use a block body and `await`.
- **Never invent a component or prop.** The vocabulary is fixed — see
  `references/ui-components.md` in the skill.
- Run `npm run typecheck` before claiming anything works.
